**BahasaIn** is an innovative mobile application designed to help international students learn Bahasa Indonesia and immerse themselves in Indonesian culture. By combining adaptive learning pathways with cultural integration, BahasaIn provides a comprehensive platform for language acquisition and cultural appreciation.

## **Description**

Indonesia is a culturally rich country with over 275 million people. Despite its vast cultural heritage and language, only a small fraction of international students study in Indonesia due to language barriers. BahasaIn aims to bridge this gap by offering a user-friendly app that not only teaches Bahasa Indonesia but also integrates Indonesian culture into the learning experience.

By providing tools for adaptive learning, cultural integration, and gamification, BahasaIn seeks to make Indonesia a welcoming destination for global learners while promoting Bahasa Indonesia as a global language.
